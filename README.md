One of the most important use cases for showcasing machine learning is image classification. The
suggested work will attempt to categorize the given input image of a species of flower using the supplied
dataset. Additionally, it generates an output in which the flowers in the input image are classified. These
days, flower identification techniques are widely employed. Even though contemporary search engines
include tools for visually searching for a query image that includes a flower, robustness is lacking
because there are millions of flower species in the world that vary within their class. As a result, the
suggested research project uses a machine learning technique utilizing convolutional neural networks
to detect extremely accurate flower species. A pre-trained network for the extraction of complex features
is used to carry out the flower picture extraction function. Furthermore, to generate a higher precision
score, a machine learning classifier like Random Forest or Logistic Regression is applied. This method
aids in lowering the hardware requirements needed to compute the demanding training task using a
convolutional neural network (CNN).
